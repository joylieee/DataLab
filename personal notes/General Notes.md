Explain to me what is markdown and give me basic syntax.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

# Math functions

Let's have a equation to describe simple linear regression:	
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

How do I type a math equation?

$$ y = x^2 $$ 

$$ 
\int_0^/infty x^2 dx
$$

Give me the equation of normal distributon

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$
